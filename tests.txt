can make a market buy order
can make a limit buy order
but order executing immedately vs execution after. orderid not defined
sets a stop if one is defined
turns the stop into a .. market sell when the target price is hit

So this is a stop gap for the next stage - it separates the pair we sell to and the pair we watch for price action
First we can:
* always use a market order for the sell. 
* detect the stop and target only based on the trades stream
