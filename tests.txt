can make a market buy order
can make a limit buy order
but order executing immedately vs execution after. orderid not defined
sets a stop if one is defined
turns the stop into a .. market sell when the target price is hit

When only -b is given it should immediately create a markey_buy order
when -b with an entry_price is given it should enter state waiting_for_entry_price
when -b and -s or -t are given it should enter state 

So this is a stop gap for the next stage - it separates the pair we sell to and the pair we watch for price action
First we can:
* always use a market order for the sell. 
* detect the stop and target only based on the trades stream
node ./binance-oco.js -p ICXUSDT -P ICXBNB -b 0.3516 -s 0.3368 -t 0.52 -q 1000
